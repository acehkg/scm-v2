##Understanding Malt Analysis
A brewer needs high brewhouse yield (extract), predictable performance and trouble free processing. The malting process builds enzymes, breaks down cell walls and proteins which makes strach accessible. There are a number of values which can be measured at a lab to indicate the quality of the malt produced. This not only helps the maltster with process and quality control but it lets the brewer know what he can expect from the malt in the brewhouse.

A good malt analysis provides a wealth of information as to how well each goal of the malting process was achieved. For endosperm (cell wall) modification we have friabilty, beta-glucan and extract. For protein modification we can consider total protein, soluble protein, S/T (ratio of soluble to total) and FAN (free amino nitrogen). For enzymatic potential we have diastatic power and alpha-amylase. Color, pH and viscosity are also measured. It's worth taking a closer look at each measurement, how it's measured, typical values and what it means for the brewer.
