## What is Malt?

Malt (malted barley) is the most important ingredient in beer. The malting process converts the starch and protein in the raw barely into fermentable sugars and useable protein for the brewer. The malted grain is rendered crushable (friable) so that brewers can easily mill the grain for mashing. The enzymes produced also make it possible for brewers to extract sugars from other cereal grains as well. For examples beers which include wheat or rice as part of their recipe. Beer production would be impossible without malt.

## The Malting Process

The maltster's mission is to modify the barley kernel, breaking down it's cell walls and protein structure to make it friable. Raw barley is hard, you wouldn't want to chew on it, but malted barley is much softer. At the same time enzymes are developed for production of fermentable sugars as well as yeast nutrients. Flavour and colour are developed and the malt is rendered stable and storeable through drying in a kiln.

### Steeping

The barley is first soaked in water to hydrate the grain and start the germination process. Mositure content is increased from approximately 12% to 45%. Steeping generally consists of two immerisions with a long air rest in between. The process generally takes around 2 days. Steeping is the foundation of the malting process and is where all the important biochemical reactions begin. After steping the water is drained and the barley is left to germinate.

### Germination

The hydrated barley is then left to germinate for 4-5 days in a carfeully controlled environment. The kernels are alive and growing at this stage so a significant amount of heat is generated. The malt is kept cool and moist with carefully controlled airflow. Germination is where the modification of the grain and enzyme production is maximized. The maltster carefully monitors the process and when he decides its complete the barley is ready for the kiln.

### Kilning

Kilning (drying) the grain consists of 2 or 3 distinct phases. The first, drying, is at a relatively low temperature and this is the phase where the grain loses most of its moisture. After drying the temperature of the kiln is slowly raised to cure the malt redering it stable. Depending on the type of malt being produced the temperature may be raised even further to darken the color and produce more flavours.

##Finished Malt
After the kilning process is complete the grain is left to cool before being cleaned and packaged. Since finshed malt is low moisture, around 5%, it is a shelf stable product that can be stored for years.
