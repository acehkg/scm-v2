## What is Hot Steep Analysis?

The hot steep method was developed as a way for maltsters, brewers and distillers to do sensory analysis of the malt they produce or use. The [ASBC (American Society of Brewing Chemists)](https://www.asbcnet.org/) hot steep method is a standardized way of preparing a sample wort for tasting and analysis.

[Draughtlab](https://www.draughtlab.com) produces base and specialty malt flavour maps that can be used to guide the taster in describing what they taste. They have also integrated the flavour maps into their amazing Draughtlab pro app which makes tracking tests and results a breeze.

## Why do we do Sensory Analysis?

Sensory analysis and the flavour maps provide a common language for people to discuss and think about malt. The impact of a malts flavour and aroma on finished products are just beginning to be understood. The bottom line is that the aroma and taste of the malt effect the taste and aroma of the final product. Having a way to analyse and discuss this impact is extremely useful.

Sensory analysis is a very important tool in the malthouse because it allows the maltster not only to evaluate quality but also consistency. Making sure each batch of a given malt possesses the desired colour, taste and aroma means there is no surprises waiting for the brewer on brew day.

Brewers and distillers can use sensory analysis to understand the flavour profile of the raw ingredients they are using, and use that information to develop new recipes or, as with the maltster, achieve a more consistent product.

## Preparing the Sample

A standard weight of malt is ground to grist and then left to steep in warm water for a while. The wort is then filtered and left to cool before analysis. The whole process takes about an hour and the standard method is enough for about 6-8 tasters.

When doing an analysis of base malts 100% of the malt used is the malt being tasted. When tasting specialty malts and darker malts a blend of base malt, and the malt being analyzed, is used to make sure the wort is representative of typical brew house scenarios and uses.

## Tasting and Analysis

This is the fun part! After the sample is prepared and cooled its time to actually do the analysis. The analysis is broken down into several different categories. They are visuals, aromas, tastes and mouthfeel.

**Visuals**
When we look at the wort we want to take careful note of a few different things. We consider the color, the haze and the size of any visible particulate.

**Aromas**
With the help of the flavour map we get a sense for the aroma of the malt. This ranges from grassy and fruity to spicy and smoky.

**Tastes**
This is fairly straightforward. Is the malt sweet, sour or bitter.

**Mouthfeel**
Hope does the malt feel in the mouth? Here we attempt to discern the body of the wort, whether it coats the mouth, is astringent or cloying.

## Example Analysis

We did an analysis on our Penville Pale Malt. It's a pale ale malt useful as a base for many types of beers and spirits. It's a low colour malt that doesn't spend too much time in the kiln at high temperatures.

Visually the wort is a dark yellow colour with a bit of haze and no particulates.

The aroma is of earth, soil, grain and raw barley with overtones of hay, honey and other sweet aromatics.

The taste is mildly sweet, subtly sour with no bitterness.

The mouthfeel is of light body, slightly dry and mouthwatering and leaving a light coating.

## Conclusion

Sensory analysis is used in many different industries as a method of quality control and product description. Using the hot steep method we are able to bring the technique to the malthouse in a standardized and repeatable way.

By leveraging the excellent [Draughtlab](https://www.draughtlab.com) tools it's very easy to monitor malt for consistency and describe the taste and aroma in simple to understand terms. The apps and website are easy to use.

While there are many practical uses for malt sensory analysis, at the end of the day tasting malt and imagining how it might impact the flavour of a beer or whiskey is a lot of fun!
