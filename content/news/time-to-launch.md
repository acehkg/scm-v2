## Welcome!

We are pleased to announce that Simcoe County Malt Inc. has started operation and has a great selection of malts available for purchase. We are proud to be bringing you quality malt made from Ontario grown grain.

The past year has reinforced the need for sustainable local ingredients and supply chains. Consumers expect their beer and spirits to not only taste great but made from quality local ingredients. Simcoe County Malt is here to help ensure you can fulfill those demands. We know the farmer who grew each grain, we know when it was harvested and we've had comprehensive quality checks done both before and after malting to make sure we are delivering a great product. It's never been easier to make sure your hand crafted Ontario beers are made with hand crafted Ontario malt.

If you have any questions or comments please reach out and get in touch.
