## What is Malt?

Have you ever wondered what brewers or distillers are talking about when they talk about malt? Would you like to know how it's made? I'll help answer those questions and more in this introduction to malt.

**Malted grains, or malt, is grain which has been allowed to germinate and then dried in a kiln. Malt is the main ingredient in most beers and many distilled spirits like whiskey. Barley is the most common grain malted today but oats, wheat, corn and rye are also malted regularly**

## Why do We Malt?

Barley and other grains all contain a high proportion of sugar and protein. Unfortunately, it is difficult to access the sugar or protein in a form that is useable for yeast. The main goal of malting is to develop enzymes, breakdown proteins and modify starches into fermentable sugars.

Brewers and distillers need fermentable sugars for the yeasts they use. They also need the nutrients that the protein in malt provide. Malted barley in particular is very high in enzymes. Those enzymes can be used to help access the sugar in any non-malted grains that a brewer might be using in his recipe as well. In short without malt making beer would be impossible.

## How is Malt Made?

The malting process has been around for millennia. In fact due to their excellent record keeping we know the ancient Egyptians were malting grains and making beer. It's not known exactly when humans stumbled on the malting process but we know it has been around for a very long time.

Today the malting process involves three major steps. Grains are first steeped in water, then allowed to germinate and then finally dried and cured in a kiln. The technology used to make malt varies widely, but the fundamentals remain the same whether traditional floor malting or using the latest equipment.

First the raw grain, which is still a living organism, is submerged in water. This is called steeping. The goal of steeping is to increase the moisture content of the grain to kickstart the biochemical processes that turn grain into malt. The moisture of the raw grain is less than 14% and that must be increased to around 45%. Depending on the grain, equipment and technique being used this can be accomplished in one steep or a series of steeps separated by periods of allowing the grain to rest in air. After steeping the grain is left to germinate.

During germination the grain continues its transformation. Starches are broken down, enzymes are created and the grain becomes softer and easier to crush. This process usually takes 4 or 5 days. The temperature of the grain is carefully controlled to make sure it stays cool and a humidity of 100% is maintained. The grain is carefully monitored to make sure things are progressing and to determine the right time to kiln. When the grain has germinated sufficiently the process is stopped by drying in the kiln.

In the kiln the malt is dried from around 45% moisture to around 5% moisture. This process stops the germination, preserves the enzymes produced and imparts colour and flavour to the final product. Depending on the temperature used a wide variety of different malts can be produced. From lighter coloured base malts kilned at low temperatures to darker Vienna and Amber malts kilned at high temperatures. Malts can also be roasted at very high temperatures to make much darker products like Chocolate malt.

## Who Makes Malt?

The artisans who make malt are called maltsters. Part art and part science malting is no easy task. Most of the worlds malt is made in few very large factories in North America, Europe and Australia. These are huge operations making thousands and thousands of tons of malt each year. The malt they make is good, but it lacks the character and unique flavours that a small maltster can produce.

Much like with craft beer, the demand for handcrafted malt has gone up drastically over the years. Consumers are increasingly demanding that not only their beers be brewed locally but that the ingredients be local as well. They want to know what farmer grew the barley, when it was harvested and when and where it was malted. This is something that the small craft maltster can provide.

A local craft maltster can work hand in hand with brewers to develop recipes, experiment and help them get the best out of their ingredients. Having the person who made the malt and can explain how to use it to it's maximum potential is an invaluable resource for a brewer. When you buy malt from a craft maltster you aren't just buying bags of grain. You are buying the passion that went into making it, the care the farmer took to grow the grain and a commitment to customer satisfaction.

The last year of COVID related restrictions has taught us that a sustainable and local supply chain is more important than ever. Having a local maltster to work with, who is working with local farmers, is a win win for everyone. From the farmer to person drinking a pint of cold beer.

## How is Malt used?

Malt is used widely in the food and beverage industry. It's used in bread making, desserts and as a sweetener in many processed foods.It's most important use is in beer and spirits. Malted barley is the main ingredient in beer and whiskey. Beer and whiskey start life very similarly by soaking crushed malt in hot water. This process is known as mashing.

When brewers or distillers make a mash they use hot water to activate the enzymes generated during the malting process and extract the sugars from the grain. It's the sugar that will be eaten by the yeast during fermentation generating alcohol and CO2.

After fermentation the mash has been turned into beer. This beer can be distilled into whiskey or poured from the tap of your favorite bar.

## Conclusion

Next time you have a sip of a cold beer or well aged whiskey make sure to think about the malt it's made from and where that malt was made. Maltsters work hard to make sure brewers and distillers have the raw ingredients the need to make great drinks. Part art and part science I hope I was able to help you understand malt and the malting process. Please reach out at <info@simcoecountymalt.com> with any questions or comments.
